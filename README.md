This program simulates the Energy-Efficiency (EE) maximization problem employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) technique. 
Compared to traditional methods, the DRL approach showcased superior EE performance. Moreover, leveraging DRL enables easy parallelization, 
leveraging available computational resources, thereby ensuring reliable time complexity for the proposed method.




This computational module employs:

Python 3.9.12
Tensorflow 2.7.0
Matplotlib
